description:
 This check checks the status of the database. If it is in "Offline" there is a CRIT, "Cold" and "Admin" give a WARN.
 In addition, this check reflects the currently running database version.
 If the "Data/Log usage" query is also executed in the plugin, there is also a check here whether the "AutoSaveStandby" option is switched on. If this is OFF then the status will be set from the rule, default for it is OK.

 In addition, this check also gives information for the HW/SW inventory.

 The agent plugin MaxDB is required for this check.
