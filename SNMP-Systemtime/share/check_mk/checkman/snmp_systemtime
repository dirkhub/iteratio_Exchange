description:
 This plugin monitors the systemtime of a SNMP-Device. It calculates the time offset between the SNMP-Device and the current time of Check_MK server it runs on. You can configure the offset for WARN/CRIT events via WATO-Rules.
 Please consider that the time offset is calculated when the SNMP response packet is arrived at Check_MK server, thus long SNMP response times might be a problem! 

perfdata:
 The offset between the time of the SNMP-Walk and Host-Time
